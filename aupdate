# This script exists to take advantage of sudo apt update being configured to
# run passwordless. Unlike the previous alias, this command will not prompt for
# a sudo password unless there are packages to upgrade.
#
# Sample /etc/sudoers.d/apt-update:
# # Allow members of sudo to run apt update passwordless
# %sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt update
# %sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
# %sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/aptitude update

#
# Make a command think stdout is a tty.
#
# Useful for commands like apt that disable colors and print warnings when
# their output is captured.
#
# NOTE 1: do not pass untrusted input to script, it will be run by a shell.
# NOTE 2: this may make it easier to observe input/output via strace, so don't
# use faketty where secrets may be input or output.
